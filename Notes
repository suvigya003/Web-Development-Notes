Server Side scripting language

- Source code is not visible to the user because its output of server-sideside is an HTML page. 
- Used to create dynamic pages.
- In this load times are generally faster than client-side scripting.
- When you need to store and retrieve information a database will be used to contain data. It can use huge resources of the server.
- It reduces client-side computation overhead.
- In this any server-side technology can be used and it does not depend on the client. 
- It runs on the webserver.
- It provides more security for data.
- Uses scripts on the webserver to produce a response that is customized for each client’s request.
- Eg:- PHP, Python, Java, Ruby.

Client Side scripting language

- Source code is visible to the user.
- Source code is used to transfer from webserver to user’s computer over the internet and run directly on browsers.
- It cannot be basically used to connect to databases on a web server.
- These scripts cannot access the file system that resides in the web browser.
- It usually depends on the browser and its version.
- It runs on the user’s computer.
- It does not provide security for data.
- Scripts run on the client’s browser.
- Eg:- HTML, CSS, and javascript

SSH

- Secure Shell Protocol
- Web Browsers talk to servers using https protocol. Similarly, SSH allows to establish secure communication between systems, 
  remotely access another computer, clone pull/push files from GitHub servers and much more. 
  SSH is essentially using a network connection to get into Terminal on another computer.
- SSH runs over port 22 by default.
- SSH breaks data into series of package and encrypts the data before transmitting.
- Three encryption techniques used by SSH are:-
  Symmetrical Encryption
  Asymmetrical Encryption - (Difiie Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm) 
      Each system generates a temporary public and private key whereas the public key is encrypted and shared to the other system and 
      is decrypted by its paired system’s private key. At this point, each system generated a symmetric keys using their individual private and shared public keys 
      to exchange messages.
  Hashing
      It generates a unique value for all the input a system receives using HMAC (hash based message authentication code).
      Client's system converts msg and symmetric key into a hash number and send it to host.
      Host also has same symm key so he also runs the same hash function on symm key and gets hash number, matches it with received one, if same then connection is 
      secured.
- Github allows to fork or pull using https and ssh but using https, at each fork or pull request, we have to provide our pswd. 
  To avoid this task we can create our own ssh key for our system and add it to our own github account.

API

- Application Programming Interface
- A software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
- These are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. 
  They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.
  Eg:- if you want to say, program some 3D graphics, it is a lot easier to do it using an API written in a higher-level language such as JavaScript or Python, 
       rather than try to directly write low level code (say C or C++) that directly controls the computer's GPU or other graphics functions.
- A Browser API can extend the functionality of a web browser. All browsers have a set of built-in Web APIs to support complex operations, and to help accessing data.
    For example, the Web Audio API provides JavaScript constructs for manipulating audio in the browser. 
    In the background, the browser is actually using some complex lower-level code (e.g. C++ or Rust) to do the actual audio processing. 
    But again, this complexity is abstracted away from you by the API.
- Third party APIs are not built into your browser. To use these APIs, you will have to download the code from the Web. Eg:- Youtube API, Twitter API etc. Somebody 
  else has written the code and we are directly installing the app and using it's functionality on our browser. It is not available with browser.
  Eg:- I have to make a tweet so I need twitter API bcz I'm not writing complete code for twitter app, neither I am writing the code for tweet 
  I'm just using the already written code(API) for tweeting on twitter which is not available with browser.
